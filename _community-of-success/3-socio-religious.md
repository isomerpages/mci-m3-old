### **Socio-Religious**
A Malay/Muslim community bound by strong spiritual resilience and togetherness.

Singaporean Malay/Muslims have always played a pivotal role in fostering community resilience, promoting interfaith understanding and nurturing a deep sense of religious identity and belonging. Such contributions are a testament to the MM community’s commitment to maintaining social and religious harmony in Singapore – a shining example of unity in diversity.
