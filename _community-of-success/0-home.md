### **About Us**
Singapore's Malay/Muslim community makes up about 15% of the total population. Being a minority Muslim community in a multi-religious and multi-racial society, we sit in a very unique position and has successfully thrived in many different areas. Since independence, we have achieved significant progress, especially in the areas of employment and education.
