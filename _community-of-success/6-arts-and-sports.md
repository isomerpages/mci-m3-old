### **Arts & Sports**
A vibrant arts and sports scene within Singapore’s Malay/Muslim community.

Singaporean Malay/Muslims in the arts and sports have flown Singapore’s flag high in their respective fields, making their marks internationally and trailblazing for others in the community to follow. From staging performances abroad to clinching awards at world championships, these artists and athletes have proven that they have what it takes to succeed at the highest level and make their country and community proud.
