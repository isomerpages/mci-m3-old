### **Leading the way by showing love, despite many struggles**

While most people credit athletes, motivational speakers or movie stars as their role models, Mr Muhammad Sahri credits his father,  Mr Jumaat, as his role model.

Mr Jumaat, who works as a cleaner, is a true testament that you can accomplish anything, no matter how hard or challenging things can get. 

Through the various hardships and challenges he faced in his life, Mr Jumaat has unknowingly become a mentor and a teacher, by simply showing his right intentions and actions. He motivates his six children and teach them to lead life in the right and noble way. Regardless of having a big family, he does not put aside his love, care and concern for any one of them.

He is resilient regardless of what life brings him, with the right intention and direction.
