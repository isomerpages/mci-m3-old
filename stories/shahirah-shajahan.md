### **A true leader who is constantly in pursuit of excellence**

Ms Shahirah is highly responsible, accountable and a role model to her peers. She demonstrates commendable resilience and empowerment when handling various challenging situations at the workplace. Within two years, she was promoted from a Waitress to a Captain. As a Captain, one is required to work under tight timeline and ensure that the assigned team completes all preparation work in time for meal service. 
 
Besides having a sound foundation in restaurant operations, Shahirah upskills herself by cross-training as a Customer Relations Officer. She quickly adapted to the role and is now competent in handling guest relations and dining reservations. She has helped improved customer relations jobs by initiating standard operating procedures checklist which provides greater productivity and gives her peers the confidence in handling guests. Additionally, Shahirah was also cross-trained at the Revenue Centre. Her co-workers can always count on her to step in and assist with reservation calls or emails when the team is shorthanded. Earlier in 2018, Ms Shahirah attended and passed the basic conversational Mandarin skills workshop organised by the hotel. This new skill helped her better connect with her peers and guests. 
 
Ms Shahirah consistently lives and breathes the hotel’s brand values (S.E.R.V.I.C.E.) and employee value propositions (trust and respect, celebrate success, passion and have fun at work) at every touch point with both internal and external guests. She can be trusted to guide, inspire and motivate her peers at work. 
 
Ms Shahirah’s passion in creating magical moments for guests is notable when she teaches choreographed dance moves to her peers. She blends well with her peers of diverse age and background, treating them with care and respect.
