### **Tech whiz who puts others before himself**

At a young age, Mr Ibrahim often accompanied his grandparents. He acquired many life skills and developed a love for nature through his grandfather who is a gardener who took care of a large acre of cemetery land in Bedok. With his grandmother, he learnt entrepreneurial skills as she sold curry puffs and kueh-kueh under the void deck back then. For all the time he helped them, he was given a small amount of money as a reward. Each time he purchased some treats, he never forget about his siblings. 

As both his parents were working back then, Mr Ibrahim took great care of his siblings. He was even a school prefect during his primary school years and also a peer leader when he was in his secondary school. 

When the Aceh Tsunami catastrophe incident took place in 2004, Mr Ibrahim and his best friend, Professor Izzuddin, were deeply impacted. They decided to volunteer with Mercy Relief during their weekends for 4 months, sorting and packing rations. He believed that nobody is too poor or too young to help others in need. If we cannot help through monetary gains, we can still help others with our volunteering efforts.

While he was teaching at Eunos Primary, he helped many students by motivating and encouraging them to never give up in life. He participated in contests and used the prize money to buy new clothes for his students for the festive season. He helped all of them regardless of race and religion. 

Mr Ibrahim then decided to find solutions for the community. That is when he embarked on his technology journey. 

He left the education service and went to Romania to learn about the disruptive emerging technology. He spent his money and savings on education and honing his technological skills. He was then sent to China, where he learnt about the disruptive technology the most. Back then, there was no courses available in Singapore about Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning or blockchain. He knew that technology is a ticket for the community to progress. At his current position, he mentors students and helps those who want to get into the technology industry. He also helps individuals who are thinking of a mid-career switch, unemployed individuals as well as those with disabilities.
