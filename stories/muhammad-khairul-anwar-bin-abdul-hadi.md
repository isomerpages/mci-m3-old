### **From ex-convict to the founder of a bakery**

When Mr Khairul was released from prison, he was determined to make a positive change and put food on the table for his family. 

However, he knew that he would not be able to get by with a monthly income of $1,000 as a dispatch rider. He needed to support his wife and their first-born son who was 2 years old then. They also urgently needed a home as they were living with their parents and 9 other family members.

With no knowledge or experience in the baking business, it was Mr Khairul who motivated and pushed his wife, Ms Nazira, to make their business work. Together, they were a team. 

Ms Nazira attended baking workshops and learnt how to bake from scratch. She played the role of the baker while Khairul would help with everything else – from marketing to delivery, and even as a baking assistant. They started Bakes by NY as a home-based baking business with support from family members and former colleagues. 

Three years and three kids later – aged 8 months, 2 years old and 5 years old – the couple opened a small bakery called Bakes by NY at East Village and also have a home they can now call as their own.
