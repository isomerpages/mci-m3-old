### **Senior inspires and encourages fostering in others**

Opening up her heart and home since 2003, Madam Norlia has given love, time, and stability to a total of six foster children, including one whom she is currently caring for. 

Besides caring for her foster children, Mdm Norlia also takes time to help out in MSF’s foster parents recruitment activities. For example, she would come by roadshows to see how she can help out, and she would conduct sharing sessions with potential foster parents. Her role is to share about her fostering experience and clarify any doubts potential applicants may have.

Mdm Norlia hopes that more people would be inspired to become foster parents so that more children would be able to be cared for and loved. This can start small, for example, by sharing about fostering with relatives and friends. 

As a foster mother, she helps the children overcome various challenges in their lives. It takes a lot of patience and love, as well as the whole family’s commitment to foster.
