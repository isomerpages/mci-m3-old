### **Imparting coding and tinkering skills to underprivileged Malay children**

You will succeed if you believe in yourself and give your best in everything you do. 
 
This is evident by how Mr Rahman made it to NUS’ Civil Engineering Program, and eventually to the Smart Nation and Digital Government Office under the Prime Minister’s Office. Mr Rahman is a role model to every other Malay/Muslim children out there aspiring to reach great heights even when the odds seem stacked against them. 
 
Mr Rahman did not just stop at his degree in Civil Engineering in NUS - he pursued a Masters programme as well, and hopes to someday do a PhD. Five years ago when he was in his final-year in NUS, Mr Rahman almost lost his legs due to a major accident. He could not walk for six months but he soon recovered with his strong willpower. 
 
With his skills, he had two start-ups during his undergraduate years (PRISM and CODE.LLECTIVE), which focused on teaching underprivileged kids skills like coding and tinkering. Rahman’s quest for knowledge has still not ended, and he is still working out his next steps as he grows as a civil servant today.
