### **A selfless individual who prioritises the community around her**

Mdm Siti Wahidah recognised the importance of uplifting the community. Even though she is a mother of 7, including a child who has special needs and is the main caregiver for her husband who suffers from critical health issues, Mdm Siti Wahidah’s commitment to the community remains steadfast. 

She holds on to two main principles – “there are always people out there who needs more help” and “doesn’t mean you are poor, you cannot do anything.” Thus, even though she faces financial challenges in managing her family, Mdm Siti Wahidah still contributes her time and energy to help the vulnerable in the community. For example, Mdm Siti Wahidah takes it upon herself to approach families in need and link them up to formal resources where appropriate so they need not have to face their challenges on their own. 

Currently, Mdm Siti Wahidah is an active member of various grassroots committees in Yio Chu Kang. She worked closely with with external organisations to explore partnerships which could be beneficial to the community. For example, together with Beyond Social Services and Balestier Khalsa FC, she coordinated the formation of a soccer team which has been going on for 8 years. This year, she had partnered with several organisations to coordinate the collection and distribution of Hari Raya essentials such as traditional outfits, Hari Raya Cookies and some food rations to those in need within the community. 

At home, Mdm Siti Wahidah strive to impart and instil the same values in her sons. Inspired by her, three of her sons are also active grassroots volunteers.

The children are also encouraged to do well in school, with Mdm Siti Wahidah prioritising their limited resources on the children’s education and personal growth. Her son, Mr Muhammad Hakim, who is in ITE Central pursuing Marine Engineering is listed on the Dean’s list and has been given opportunities to do humanitarian aid in Thailand.  Encouraged by Mdm Siti Wahidah, her eldest son, Mr Muhammad Shahrom, pursued his diploma education whilst working in the police force and is exploring higher education options now.
