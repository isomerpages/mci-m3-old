### **About Logo**

The M<sup>3</sup> logo is made up of 3 Ms joining together to form a cube. The Ms represent 3 agencies - Muis, MENDAKI and MESRA. The 3-coloured gradients represent the collaboration between the agencies.

Together with the tagline “Maju Bersama M<sup>3</sup>”, which translates to “Progressing with M<sup>3</sup>”, the logo represents M<sup>3</sup>’s commitment to work in synergy and unity to promote a Singapore Malay/Muslim community that progresses together on a meritocracy that is inclusive and collaborative.
