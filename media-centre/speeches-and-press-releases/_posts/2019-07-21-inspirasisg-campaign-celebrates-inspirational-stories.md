MEDIA FACTSHEET 

**#InspirasiSG Campaign Celebrates Inspirational Stories of the Singapore Malay/Muslims Community**

1. In celebration of M³’s #InspirasiSG campaign, ten exemplary individuals were given recognition for exhibiting the three “C”s – Character (strong values and morals), Competency (lifelong learning and skills upgrading) and Citizenry (active community contribution) – which are the enduring values that have built the Malay/Muslim community into a Community of Success. 

2.	The #InspirasiSG campaign, which ran from 17 June to 21 July 2019, sought to showcase the Singapore Malay/Muslim community as a Community of Success, one that is progressive yet rooted in its traditions and identity, with a strong spirit of self-help and practises active citizenry as its way of life. This was the vision which was unveiled by Minister for the Environment and Water Resources and Minister-in-charge of Muslim Affairs, Mr Masagos Zulkifli during his Hari Raya Get-Together on 14 June 2019. 

3.	As part of the campaign, Singaporeans were encouraged to nominate inspirational members from the Malay/Muslim community who have inspired them in one way or another, in all or any of the three “C”s.  The contest ran from 17 June to 14 July and was publicised through various print, broadcast, digital and social media platforms. 

4.	Showcasing such inspiring stories helps to promote positive conversations on the success of the Malay/Muslim community and serves as an example of how resilient and inspiring the community is.  Close to 350 inspiring stories were submitted by members of public during the contest period. Ten individuals with the most inspiring stories received $500 worth of vouchers each at the #InspirasiSG award ceremony, which was graced by Minister Masagos. 

6.	These quiet heroes are the epitome of the campaign’s tagline – Hidup berbakti, ikhlas berbudi – means doing good without expecting anything in return. The tagline was part of the campaign’s effort to redefine success as one that is more values-based, highlighting the greater reward in making a difference to other people’s lives.
