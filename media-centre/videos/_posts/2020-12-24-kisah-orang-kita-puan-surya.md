"As a nurse and front liner, everything is on your shoulders," shared Ms Surya, a nurse stationed at the Singapore Expo Community Care Facility for COVID-19 patients. 

After weighing the risks, Ms Surya made the call to serve at the Facility for the greater good. She recalls her experience; from when she first heard that COVID-19 had become a global pandemic to setting up and serving an entire Singapore Expo Hall for hundreds of incoming patients alongside other front liners. 

Despite the long hours and challenges, her colleagues became pillars of strength for one another, and together they carried out their duties tenaciously. 

This is her story.
Inilah Kisah Orang Kita.
