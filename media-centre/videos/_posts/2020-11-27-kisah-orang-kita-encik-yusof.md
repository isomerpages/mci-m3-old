Bila ingin sambung belajar, ada yang berkata, "Alamak, otak dah karat lah." 
Tetapi bagi pasangan suami isteri, Encik Mohamed Yusof dan Puan Seridewi, menimba kemahiran baru sesuatu yang perlu dilakukan demi masa depan mereka.

As many livelihoods were affected this year, Mr Mohamed Yusof knew he had to do something to secure a brighter future. From scaling tall structures as a rope access technician, Mr Yusof took up jobs as a private hire driver and then as a food delivery rider, all while completing courses on rigging and signaling. Backed by his wife who also took up courses to enhance her home based business, they remained resilient together.

This is their story.
Inilah Kisah Orang Kita.
