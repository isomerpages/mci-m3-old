Helen Keller once said: “Alone, we can do so little. Together, we can do so much.”

M³ aims to harness the strengths of Islamic Religious Council of Singapore (MUIS), MENDAKI Singapore and People's Association Malay Activity Executive Committees Council (MESRA) and other partners to uplift the Malay/Muslim community. Let us look out for each other so that no one is left behind.
