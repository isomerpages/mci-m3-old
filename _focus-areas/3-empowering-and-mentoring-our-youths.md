Our youths play a key part in the future of Singapore and our Malay/Muslim community. We support our youths and develop their strengths and capabilities through empowerment programmes that aim to open up opportunities for them to embark on various education and career pathways.

Mentoring is also an important component of youths development. Connecting youths with mentors and role-models in the community, while bridging them to resources, schemes and training programmes, helps guide and inspire them to realise their potential.

All our empowerment programmes are based on a mentoring-centric model, where the youths can interact and learn from mentors and young professionals. Through this, we aim to develop a vibrant Malay/Muslim youths core, inspiring each youth to continue to pay it forward and give back to the community.

### **Project SOAR (under M³@CCK)**

Project SOAR is a key initiative under M³ Focus Area 3 (Empowering & Mentoring For Youth) to develop youth with character, competence and a strong spirit of active citizenry. The programme was piloted in Chua Chu Kang and Jurong in 2020. 

Spearheaded by M³@Towns, Project SOAR is a nine-month community-led mentoring programme which will see mentees (youths aged 14 to 16 years old) matched to older youth mentors (youths aged 17 to 35 years old) and undergo a multitude of engagement activities including those related to career, community service and culture. Mentors will journey with their mentees by connecting them to opportunities, services and positive role models during their engagement sessions. Mentees will also have the opportunity to participate in activities organised by the Community Clubs Youth Executive Committees (YECs) within each M³@Towns.

Under Project SOAR, M³@Towns will reach out to neighbourhood schools and full-time Madrasahs to encourage students to sign up as mentees under the programme. Concurrently, M³@Towns also reach out to youths from institutes of higher learning (i.e. Universities, Polytechnics, ITEs, JCs), mosques and young professionals to sign up as mentors, and undergo basic mentoring training conducted by Mendaki.

### **Empowerment Programme @ ITE**

The Empowerment Programme @ ITE aims to bridge ITE students to opportunities to help maximise their potential and provide good role models through mentoring. Mentors were trained in Gift Centred Mentoring approach to help them nurture the strengths of mentees and guide them to achieve their education and career aspirations.

### **Mentor Manual**

A comprehensive manual produced by the Youth Mentoring Office (YMO) to guide mentors in their mentoring journey. Titled ‘The Gift of Mentoring: A Guide for Mentors’, it complements the Gift-Centred Mentoring (GCM) training that mentors undergo before deployment. It aims to aid mentors to better understand the GCM philosophy through exciting infographics and videos. The manual supports mentors in rapport building by engaging mentees in fun activities that can help both to open up and deepen conversations, and it shares available resources that mentors can tap on to better guide and support their mentees.
