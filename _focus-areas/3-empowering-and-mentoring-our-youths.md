![Empowering and Mentoring Our Youths](/images/focus-area-empowering.jpg)

Our youth play a key part in the future of Singapore, and in our Malay/Muslim community. We therefore endeavour to prepare our youth for what lies ahead, developing their strengths and capabilities through empowerment programmes that widen opportunities for various education and career pathways.

Apart from providing our youth with resources, schemes and training programmes, mentoring is an equally important component of their development. Connecting our youth with mentors and role models in the community helps guide and inspire them to realise their potential.

All our empowerment programmes are thus designed based on a mentoring-centric model, where our youth can interact and learn from experienced mentors and young professionals. Through this, we aim to develop a vibrant Malay/Muslim youth core, who are motivated to pay it forward and give back to the community.

### **Youth Mentoring Office (YMO)** 

The Youth Mentoring Office (YMO) was set up within MENDAKI in August 2019, to spearhead mentoring efforts in the Malay/Muslim community. It aims to build a strong mentoring culture and ecosystem, where youth are connected and actively contributing to the aspiration of a Community of Success. This is achieved by adopting and contextualizing the Gift-Centred Mentoring (GCM) philosophy, a trademarked and evidence-based mentoring model from the Youth Mentoring Connection (YMC) based in Los Angeles, USA, to enhance and build the competency of the community.

For any questions seeking enquiries to the Youth Mentoring Office, please email ymo@mendaki.org.sg 

### **Gift-Centred Mentor Training**

In driving the mentoring ecosystem, the YMO aims to build mentoring capabilities in both volunteer mentors and programme managers, based on the GCM approach. 

YMO builds capabilities of mentors through GCM Training that equips mentors with skills on building a successful relationship with their mentees. The GCM mentor training spreads across 3 modules that covers:

Module 1: Foundations of Mentoring (Mandatory e-learning) <br>
Module 2: Five pillars of GCM (Mandatory) <br>
Module 3: Practices in GCM (Optional) <br>

Over 1,100 mentors have been trained and deployed to mentor 3,655 mentees across the six mentoring programmes which the YMO oversees. 

To ensure continued support beyond the above training, mentors also have access to the mentor manual and monthly Community of Practice (COP) sessions that encourage deep learning and exchange of best practices amongst seasoned and new mentors. COP targets specific mentor challenges such as rapport building, goal setting, and working well with different personalities amongst other topics.

### **Mentor Manual**

A comprehensive manual produced by the Youth Mentoring Office (YMO) to guide mentors in their mentoring journey. Titled ‘The Gift of Mentoring: A Guide for Mentors’, it complements the Gift-Centred Mentoring (GCM) training that mentors undergo before deployment. It aims to aid mentors to better understand the GCM philosophy through exciting infographics and videos. The manual supports mentors in rapport building by engaging mentees in fun activities that can help both to open up and deepen conversations, and it shares available resources that mentors can tap on to better guide and support their mentees.
