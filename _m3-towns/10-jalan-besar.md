M³@Jalan Besar believes that the community needs to be progressive as they confront the challenges, changes, and diversity in our society. This will ensure a resilient and adaptive attitude towards their goals in life. It is important to inculcate an inclusive and contributive mindset in order to be a significant part of our social ethos and identity in Singapore.

Launched in February 2021, M³@Jalan Besar aims to build a strong network of partners and volunteers to support vulnerable families, with a strong emphasis on mental health and digital literacy. M³@Jalan Besar was formed to streamline the efforts of the seven Malay Activity Executive Committees (MAEC) and 14 mosques in Jalan Besar GRC in meeting the needs of the Malay/ Muslim community in the GRC. 

Together with representatives from MUIS and MENDAKI, M³@Jalan Besar strives to work with the Malay/Muslim professionals to be a one-stop centre for local customised programmes dedicated in meeting the residents’ ever-changing needs. One of such programmes is the ongoing Project Kukoh which targets to uplift the quality of life of residents in Jalan Kukoh through a collaboration with Masjid Omar Kampong Melaka. Through their strategic efforts, they will address community challenges as well as offer empowering, meaningful, and current learning opportunities that awaken a sense of purpose, love, and confidence amongst the residents.
