Wisma Geylang Serai (WGS) has been envisioned as the community, social, civic and cultural heart of the Geylang Serai
precinct. The WGS hub is a culturally distinctive and inclusive multi-agency development that celebrates the heritage of
Geylang Serai and all other local communities so as to encourage social interaction and community bonding across all
ages and races. It houses the Geylang Serai Community Club, South East Community Development Council, Geylang
Serai Heritage Gallery, KURNIA@WGS, arts houses as well as other social and community-related facilities.
