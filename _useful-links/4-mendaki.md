### Empowering Excellence Through Education

Formed in 1982, Yayasan MENDAKI (Council for the Development of Singapore Malay/ Muslim Community) is dedicated
to empowering the community through excellence in education, in the context of a multi-racial and multi-religious
Singapore. MENDAKI programmes and services are streamlined into three key pillars — School-Ready, Perform in
School and Future Ready.

MENDAKI programmes are highly subsidised to enhance its accessibility to as many Muslim families as possible,
supplementing or complementing national initiatives. Programmes include the MENDAKI Tuition Scheme, Mentoring for
Youths and Parenting Workshops. MENDAKI also provides financial assistance schemes for education such as bursaries
and study loans.
