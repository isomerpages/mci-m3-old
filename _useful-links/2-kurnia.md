A one-stop centre providing social, education, welfare, arts and media services, KURNIA stands for “Khidmat untuk Rakyat: Nadi, Inspirasi dan Aspirasi”, which translates to “Services for the community, pulse, inspiration and aspiration”. 

KURNIA seeks to serve community needs within a centralised and dedicated Malay-centric community space. It provides convenient access to assistance by co-locating the Malay Muslim Organisations (MMOs) and also by promoting awareness of the readily available services that are provided by the MMOs. The participating agencies include Association of Muslim Professionals (AMP), Berita Harian, Creative Malay Arts and Culture, Lembaga Biasiswa Kenangan Maulud (LBKM), Muhammadiyah, PERGAS, Tabung Amal Aidilfitri (TAA) and Persatuan Persuratan Pemuda Pemudi Melayu (4PM).
