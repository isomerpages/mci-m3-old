### **Language & Culture**
A Malay/Muslim community strongly defined by our national language and rich cultural heritage.

In an increasingly globalised world, Malay/Muslim Singaporeans have maintained a strong cultural identity by being rooted in our traditions, cultural rites, and vibrant language. To preserve and honour the significance of Bahasa Melayu, annual campaigns such as Bulan Bahasa (Malay Language Month) and Malay CultureFest are organised annually to promote usage of the Malay language and foster deeper understanding of Malay culture.
