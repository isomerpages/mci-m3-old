### **Language & Culture**
A Malay/Muslim community strongly defined by our national language and rich cultural heritage.

In an increasingly globalised world, Malay/Muslim Singaporeans have maintained a strong cultural identity by being rooted in our traditions, cultural rites, and vibrant language. To preserve and honour the significance of Bahasa Melayu, annual campaigns such as Bulan Bahasa (Malay Language Month) and Malay CultureFest are organised annually to promote usage of the Malay language and foster deeper understanding of Malay culture.

#### **Hari Raya Light-Up**
The Hari Raya Light-Up was launched by Wisma Geylang Serai (WGS) to celebrate Hari Raya festivities by putting up vibrant street lightings and decorations along Geylang Road and Sims Avenue.

The theme for 2023 - "Masyarakat Gemilang - Community of Success" - was aimed to symbolise how the Malay/Muslim community overcame the adversities of the COVID-19 pandemic through the 3Cs of Character, Competency, and Citizenry.

#### **GeylangGang Dikir**
First organised by WGS in 2022, the GeylangGang Dikir is a group singing competition launched in celebration of the Malay Language month (Bulan Bahasa). Following the successes of its inaugural event last year and its feature in National Day Rally, GeylangGang Dikir 2023 returned this year to take everyone on a journey back in time to commemorate the humble beginnings of 'Dikir Singapura'.
